WPSSO Place and Local Business Meta (WPSSO PLM) works in conjunction with the [WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) plugin, extending its features with additional settings pages, tabs, and options, to include Facebook / Open Graph *Location* and Pinterest Rich Pin / Schema *Place* meta tags in your webpages.

= Quick List of Features =

**WPSSO PLM Free / Basic Features**

* Adds a *Place / Location* tab in the Social Settings metabox for Posts, Pages, and custom post types (e-commerce product pages, etc.), where you can enter a custom street address, city, state / province, zip / postal code, country, latitude, longitude, altitude, and business hours.
* Provides Facebook / Open Graph and Pinterest Rich Pin / Schema *Place*, location, and address meta tags:
	* og:latitude
	* og:longitude
	* og:altitude
	* place:street_address
	* place:locality
	* place:region
	* place:postal_code
	* place:country_name
	* place:location:latitude
	* place:location:longitude
	* place:location:altitude
	* address
* Defines the Schema Type as a *Place* or *LocalBusiness* (complete markup requires the [WPSSO JSON Pro](https://wpsso.com/extends/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) extension).

* Manage a default set of addresses, including their geo coordinates and business hours.
* Select a default address under the *Place / Location* tab instead of entering custom values.
