WPSSO Core extension to provide Pinterest Place, Facebook / Open Graph Location, Schema Local Business, and Local SEO meta tags.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-plm/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Provides location / local business information for your website, business, and/or content.**

**Let Pinterest, Facebook and Google know about your locations:**

Include Pinterest Rich Pin - Schema Place, Facebook - Open Graph Location, and Google - Schema Local Business meta tags in your webpages.

Select a Job Location for the Schema Job Posting markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

**WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta can be used in two different ways:**

<span style="color:#33cc33">&#x0229b;</span> &nbsp; To provide location information for the content of the current webpage.

<span style="color:#33cc33">&#x0229b;</span> &nbsp; To provide location information for an Organization, which in turn is related to the content (for example, the content publisher).

**To assign location information to an Organization, you will need to use the [WPSSO Organization Markup extension](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/) along with the WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta (aka WPSSO PLM) extension.**

The Free version of WPSSO PLM can add location information to the main entity (aka the primary Schema type) of a *blog front page*. If you're using a *static front page*, or would like to include location information for the content of other posts / pages, you'll need the Pro version.

**WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its extensions make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light.

WPSSO Core and its extensions are fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).
