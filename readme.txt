**Let Pinterest, Facebook and Google know about your location(s):**

Include Pinterest Rich Pin *Place*, Facebook / Open Graph *Location*, and Google *Local Business / Local SEO* meta tags in your webpages.

**The WPSSO Place and Local SEO Markup (aka WPSSO PLM) add-on can be used in two different ways:**

* To provide location information for an Organization, which in turn may be related to the content (ie. the content publisher, event organizer, etc.).

* To provide location information for the webpage content (ie. the post/page content is about a specific physical place) (Premium add-on).

Note that the [WPSSO Organization Markup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/) (aka WPSSO ORG) add-on is required to select a location for an organization / local business.
