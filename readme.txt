WPSSO extension to provide Pinterest Place, Facebook / Open Graph Location, Schema Local Business, and Local SEO meta tags.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-plm/assets/icon-256x256.png">

<p><strong>Provides location / local business information for your website, business, and/or content.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let Pinterest, Facebook and Google know about your locations</strong> &mdash; WPSSO PLM includes Pinterest Rich Pin / Schema <em>Place</em>, Facebook / Open Graph <em>Location</em>, and Google / Schema <em>Local Business</em> meta tags in your webpages.</p>

= How Do I Use It? =

The WPSSO PLM extension can be used in two different ways:

* To provide location information for the content of the current webpage.
* To provide location information for an Organization, which in turn is related to the content (for example, the content publisher). To assign location information to an Organization, you will also need to use the WPSSO ORG extension.

The Free version of WPSSO PLM can add location information to the main entity (aka the primary Schema type) of a *blog front page*. If you're using a *static front page*, or would like to include location information for the content of other posts / pages, you'll need the Pro version.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> &mdash; WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta is an extension for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO core plugin</a>, which <em>automatically</em> generates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your content for social media optimization (SMO) and SEO.</p>

<ul>
<li>The WPSSO PLM Free extension works with either the WPSSO Free or Pro core plugin.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-plm/?utm_source=wpssoplm-readme-prereq">WPSSO PLM Pro extension</a> uses many WPSSO Pro core plugin features and requires the <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/?utm_source=wpssoplm-readme-prereq">WPSSO Pro core plugin</a>.</li>
<ul>
