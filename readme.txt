== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-plm/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**A WPSSO Core add-on to provide Pinterest Place, Facebook / Open Graph Location, Schema Local Business, and Local SEO meta tags.**

Let Pinterest, Facebook and Google know about your locations &mdash; include Pinterest Rich Pin Place, Facebook / Open Graph Location, and Google Local Business meta tags in your webpages. Select a Job Location for the Schema Job Posting markup ([WPSSO JSON Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) required).

WPSSO Place / Location and Local Business Meta can be used in two different ways:

&#x0229b; &nbsp; To provide location information for the content of the current webpage.

&#x0229b; &nbsp; To provide location information for an Organization, which in turn is related to the content (for example, the content publisher).

Note that to assign location information to an Organization, you will also need the [WPSSO Organization Markup add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/) as well. ;-)

The Free version of WPSSO PLM can add location information to the main entity (aka the primary Schema type) of a *blog front page*. If you're using a static front page, or would like to include location information for the content of other posts / pages, you'll need the Pro version.

The [WPSSO PLM Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-plm/?utm_source=wpssoplm-readme) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features and requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssoplm-readme).
